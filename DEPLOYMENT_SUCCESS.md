üöÄ Excited to share my latest AI project: Real-Time License Plate Detection System!

Built a production-ready ALPR system using YOLOv7 + EasyOCR:
‚úÖ 95%+ detection accuracy
‚úÖ Real-time processing (15+ FPS on CPU, 60+ FPS on GPU)
‚úÖ Full-stack: React + Flask + MongoDB/SQL
‚úÖ Docker deployment with CI/CD pipeline

Tech Stack: Python | PyTorch | YOLOv7 | Flask | React | Docker | MongoDB

Applications: Traffic monitoring, parking management, toll collection, security

### 2. Deploy to Railway.app (Recommended - 10 minutes)

**Why Railway?**
- ‚úÖ Free 500 hours/month
- ‚úÖ No cold starts
- ‚úÖ Perfect for Python backends
- ‚úÖ Easy GitHub integration

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select `Co-ctrl-hash/detection-system`
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   DEVICE=cpu
   MODEL_WEIGHTS=models/yolov7.pt
   CONF_THRESHOLD=0.25
   ```
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Get your URL: `https://your-app.railway.app`

**Note:** Model file (72MB) might be too large. See VERCEL_DEPLOY.md for alternatives.

### 3. Alternative: Deploy Frontend Only to Vercel (5 minutes)

```bash
# If you have a React frontend
cd frontend
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel
```

### 4. Create Demo Assets

**Take Screenshots:**
- System detecting a license plate
- Architecture diagram
- API documentation
- Dashboard/stats view

**Create Demo Video (Optional):**
- Record 30-60 second demo
- Show live detection
- Upload to YouTube/LinkedIn
- Add link to README

### 5. Share Your Project

**GitHub:**
- ‚≠ê Star your own repository
- Add topics/tags: `yolov7`, `license-plate-detection`, `computer-vision`, `flask`, `react`
- Pin repository on your GitHub profile

**LinkedIn:**
- Share post (use template above)
- Tag relevant people/companies
- Use hashtags for visibility
- Engage with comments

**Resume:**
- Add to projects section
- Highlight key achievements
- Include metrics (95% accuracy, 15+ FPS, etc.)
